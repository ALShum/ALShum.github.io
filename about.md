[CV/Resume](images/other/Shum_net.pdf)

### Bio
I'm a PhD student in statistics at Iowa State University.  My interests are in machine learning, data mining, computational statistics, and data visualization.  Before I came to Iowa State University, I was briefly in the math program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  

### Hobbies and interests
I like programming and weird data structures like kd-trees and bloom filters. 

I think sudokus are awesome and I wrote a sudoku solver in java last year and I also wrote one in R a couple months ago -- they should be on my github somewhere.  I'm currently working on a solver for mathdoku and a sudoku solver using Knuth's algorithm X.

### Projects
My [github](http://www.github.com/ALShum) has some of what I'm currently working on.

### Books
[List of books](http://amzn.com/w/2J5XOKS2XTJT7) that are on my list to read eventually.
