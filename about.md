[CV/Resume](not_posted_yet)

### Bio
I'm a PhD student in statistics at Iowa State University.  My interests are in machine learning, data mining, computational statistics, and data visualization.  Before I came to Iowa State University, I was briefly in the math program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  

### Hobbies and interests
I like programming and problem solving.  I wrote a sudoku solver in java last year and I also wrote one in R a couple months ago.  I love weird data structures like kd-trees and bloom filters. 

### Projects
My [github](http://www.github.com/ALShum) has some of what I'm currently working on.
