[CV/Resume](/images/other/Shum_net.pdf)

### Bio
I'm a PhD student in statistics at Iowa State University.  My interests are in machine learning, data mining, computational statistics, and data visualization.  Before I came to Iowa State University, I was briefly in the math program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  

### Hobbies and interests
I like programming and [puzzles](projecteuler.net).  I think sudokus are awesome; I always try to write a sudoku solver in languages I'm learning.  I've previously written a sudoku solver in Java, R, C, Julia and Matlab.  

### Projects
My [github](http://www.github.com/ALShum) has some of what I'm currently working on.

### Books
[List of books](http://amzn.com/w/2J5XOKS2XTJT7) that are on my list to read eventually.
