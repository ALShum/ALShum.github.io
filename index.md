Hi, my name is Alex.  I'm a graduate student in statistics at Iowa State University.  You can find more info and how to contact me [here](/about/).  I also have random [posts](/posts/) about statistics and programming; this is mainly so I don't forget things!

Here are some of my favorite things unrelated to math/statistics/computer science:

* Itoen [Oi Ocha](http://www.itoen.com/ready-to-drink/oi-ocha/oi-ocha-16-9-fl-oz-24-bottles-case) bottled green tea.

* [Hedgehogs!](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/10760008/In-pictures-The-many-faces-of-Marutaro-the-hedgehog.html?frame=2879441)

* Blink html tags, comic sans ms font and gifs in place of video.

* The ice king!
