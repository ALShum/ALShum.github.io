Hi, my name is Alex.  I'm a graduate student in statistics at Iowa State University.  You can find more info and how to contact me [here](/about/).  I also have random [posts](/posts/) about statistics and programming; this is mainly so I don't forget things!

Here are some of my favorite things unrelated to math/statistics/computer science:

* Itoen [Oi Ocha](http://www.itoen.com/ready-to-drink/oi-ocha/oi-ocha-16-9-fl-oz-24-bottles-case) bottled green tea.

* Scourges of the internet: <blink> html tags, comic sans ms font and low resolution jpegs/gifs.

* Admiral Ackbar
